## 1. `mkdir` Command
The `mkdir` command is used to **create directories**.

### Syntax:
```
mkdir [options] directory_name
```

### Common Options:
- **`-p`**: Create parent directories if they don't exist.

### Example:
```bash
mkdir my_directory
mkdir -p parent_directory/child_directory
```
In the first example, `my_directory` is created in the current directory. In the second, both `parent_directory` and `child_directory` are created if they donâ€™t already exist.
