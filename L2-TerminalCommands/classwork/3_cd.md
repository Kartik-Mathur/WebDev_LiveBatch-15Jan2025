## 1. `cd` Command - Change Directory

The `cd` (change directory) command is used to **navigate between directories** in the file system.

### Syntax:
```
cd [directory_name]
```

### Common Uses:

- Change to the specified directory:
  ```bash
  cd /home/user
  ```
  This will take you to the `/home/user` directory.

- Move to the parent directory:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
  This moves you up one level in the directory structure.

- Move to the home directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```
  The `~` symbol represents your home directory.

- Move to the previous directory:
  ```bash
  cd -
  ```
  This will switch to the directory you were in before your last `cd` command.
